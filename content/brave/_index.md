## Classification of "known trackers"

Brave classifies tracking domains using input from multiple **lists**:

* [EasyList](https://easylist.to/easylist/easylist.txt)
* [EasyPrivacy](https://easylist.to/easylist/easyprivacy.txt)
* [uBlock Origin Unbreak](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/uBlockOrigin/uAssets/master/filters/unbreak.txt)
* [uBlock Origin Filters](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/uBlockOrigin/uAssets/master/filters/filters.txt)
* [uBlock Origin Filters - Privacy](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/uBlockOrigin/uAssets/master/filters/privacy.txt)
* [Brave's own Unbreak list](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brave/adblock-lists/master/brave-unbreak.txt)
* [Brave's own cryptominer list](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brave/adblock-lists/master/coin-miners.txt)
* [Brave's fork of Disconnect.me](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brave/adblock-lists/master/brave-disconnect.txt)

Brave matches each outgoing request from the web browser against these lists (using various methods for achieving [optimized performance](https://brave.com/improved-ad-blocker-performance/)), and if a match is made, the request is **blocked**.

**Note!** If the resource that should be blocked is **same-site** to the site the user is browsing, the request will **not** be blocked. Thus if the user is browsing `www.domain.com` and the browser sends a request to `blocked-tracker.domain.com` (which **is** in Brave's filter lists), the request will not be blocked.

{{% notice note %}}

**Example**: The user visits a site that tries to load the Google Analytics JavaScript library from `https://www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js`. This URL (and the entire domain, in fact), is listed in the [EasyPrivacy list](https://easylist.to/easylist/easyprivacy.txt). Thus Brave blocks the request, preventing the browser from downloading the library and executing the Google Analytics tracking code in the web browser.

{{% /notice %}}

By blocking requests upstream, it means that if the request initiated a resource download (such as a JavaScript library), this resource is never downloaded and thus the code is not executed in the user's browser. If the request initiated a pixel call (such as a GET for an image), it means the pixel call will be aborted before it is received by the endpoint.

## Third-party cookies

**All** third-party cookies are blocked by default in subresource requests (e.g. CDN loads, pixel pings).

{{< figure src="/images/content/brave-cookie-block.jpg" title="Brave uses \"cross-site\" interchangeably with \"third-party\" in this case" class="left-align" >}}

In frames (e.g. `<iframe>`), access is **partitioned** and set to **site-length** expiration.

**Partitioned access** means that the `document.cookie` API will work in a cross-site `<iframe>`, but the storage will be unique between the site embedding the frame and the frame itself. Another site embedding the same frame would have a different storage profile.

**Site-length** expiration means that as soon as the last page of the site embedding the cross-site frame is closed, the partitioned storage is cleared. This is different to how e.g. Safari works, where the storage is cleared only upon the browser being closed (this clears the storage also in Brave).

## First-party cookies

For cookies set with JavaScript's `document.cookie`, expiration is set to a maximum of **7 days**.

{{% notice note %}}

**Example**: The user visits a page that is running an A/B testing tool which stores the experiment details into a cookie named `__exp`. This cookie is set with **JavaScript**. Even though setting the cookie works, and the user is assigned to an experiment group successfully, if the user takes more than **7 days** to revisit the site, the cookie will have been expired and the user would potentially get assigned to a new, different group upon their next visit.

{{% /notice %}}

For cookies set with the `Set-Cookie` HTTP response header, expiration is set to a maximum of **6 months**.

## Other third-party storage

**Partitioned** and **site-length** expiration for `localStorage` and `sessionStorage` APIs (see [Third-party cookies](#third-party-cookies) for more information).

{{% notice info %}}

Note that since Brave *blocks* resources found in their [classification lists](#classification-of-known-trackers), it has the downstream effect of blocking storage access from these vendors who now can't execute their JavaScript in the user's browser or respond to the blocked HTTP requests.

## Other first-party storage

No restrictions.

## CNAME cloaking

Brave Shields blocks network requests to domains in Brave's blocklists. With version 1.17.73, Brave now also resolves the DNS of any given domain and identifies if there are [**CNAME records**](https://medium.com/nextdns/cname-cloaking-the-dangerous-disguise-of-third-party-trackers-195205dc522a) pointing to domains that are in the [blocklists](/brave/#classification-of-known-trackers), and blocks these as a result, too.

{{% notice note %}}

**Example**: The web page sends a pixel request to `https://measure.example`. This domain is **not** in Brave's blocklist, so Brave would normally allow the network request to complete. However, `measure.example` is a CNAME record which actually points to `track.everything`, which **is** in Brave's blocklist. As the domain the CNAME points to is in Brave's blocklist, Brave blocks the initial request to `https://measure.example` as a consequence.

## Referrer

Cross-site referrers are **spoofed** in non-navigational HTTP requests. 

{{% notice note %}}

**Example**: If the page on `https://domain.com/page` requests a resource from `https://anotherdomain.com/image.jpg`, the `referer` header in the HTTP requests will be set to the **referred-to** origin (`https://anotherdomain.com/`) rather than the **referred-from** origin (`https://domain.com/`) as is the typical behavior.

{{% /notice %}}

For top-level navigation, cross-site referrers default to `strict-origin-when-cross-origin` unless the site requires an even stricter policy..

{{% notice note %}}

**Example**: When clicking a link from `https://domain.com/page` to `https://anotherdomain.com/another-page/`, the `referer` header is set to `https://domain.com`. Similarly, the `document.referrer` will be set to `https://domain.com` once the user lands on `anotherdomain.com`.

{{% /notice %}}

For same-site requests (both navigational and non-navigational), referrer has **normal** behavior.

## Other

Brave [removes known tracker identifier parameters](https://github.com/brave/brave-browser/issues/4239) from URL strings. On top-level navigation (e.g. landing on a page with such parameters in the URL), the parameters are stripped out in a 307 internal redirect. On non-navigational HTTP requests, the parameter is stripped from the request URL.

Here is the list of parameters that are stripped:

* `fbclid` (Facebook)
* `gclid` (Google)
* `msclkid` (Microsoft)
* `mc_eid` (Mailchimp)
* `yclid` (Yandex/Yahoo)
* `_hsenc`, `__hssc`, `__hstc`, `__hsfp`, `hsCtaTracking` (HubSpot)

{{% notice note %}}

**Example**: If the user types `https://www.domain.com/?fbclid=1.2.3.4` in the omnibox and presses enter, Brave strips the parameter in an internal redirect. Similarly, if the browser makes a request to `https://www.domain.com/tracking-pixel.gif?mc_eid=23456`, Brave strips the parameter out of the request before it hits the target server.

{{% /notice %}}

Brave has lots of initiatives for [neutralizing fingerprinting surfaces](https://brave.com/brave-fingerprinting-and-privacy-budgets/), with features such as [randomized HTML canvas fingerprints](https://github.com/brave/brave-browser/issues/5614) preferred over just removing or clearing the fingerprint surfaces.

On macOS Brave, the version number in the User Agent string is frozen to `10_15_7` to fix compatibility issues with upgrading to macOS version 11+ (Big Sur). This has obvious privacy implications as well, as the platform version is no longer useful for fingerprinting purposes.
