There are a number of ways in which data exploitation is attempted. On this page, these will be listed superficially.

The problem is that all these method also serve **valid** and **benign** use cases, which means that when browsers seek to prevent these, they also end up preventing non-malicious and non-exploitative use of browser storage. 

And this is the nature of the beast. The very same APIs and methodologies that are used, for example, to improve the user experience of the site, are being repurposed by third parties for malicious data collection and manipulation.

See the chapter on [Impact](/introduction/impact/) for more details on how countering these exploits is impacting other, non-harmful use cases.

The exploits listed here are:

1. [Cookies in third-party context](#cookies-in-third-party-context)
2. [Cookie syncing](#cookie-syncing)
3. [CNAME records](#cname-records)
4. [URL decoration](#url-decoration)
5. [Referrer decoration](#referrer-decoration)

## Cookies in third-party context

Leveraging browser cookies in **third-party context** (so-called *third-party cookies*) is the age-old way how advertising technology vendors build audiences for improving their targeting mechanisms.

By observing the user's browsing behavior across the web, ad tech vendors can build robust profiles and deduce the user's interest and affinity groups based on the sites they visit. Naturally, the robustness of this profiling depends on how many sites are included in this network, which is why large technology companies have the upper hand due to an extended reach and an established ecosystem.

These vendors are able to build these audiences if the user's browser **does not block access to these cookies in a third-party context**.

For example, if you browse a site that has a [Google DoubleClick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DoubleClick) pixel firing, or has [Google Analytics](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/7532985?hl=en) set up in a way so that the site communicates with DoubleClick servers, you might see the following network request: 

{{< figure src="/images/content/dc-request-first-site.jpg" class="left-align" title="Request to DoubleClick on the first site" >}}

It's a request to DoubleClick's domain (the request URL is something like `https://1234567.fls.doubleclick.net/activityi...`). As you can see in the **cookie** header, the user's browser has cookies set on this domain, and one of these cookies is named `DSID` with a long, hashed identifier string.

Now, visit *another*, completely different site that also sends requests to DoubleClick servers and observe the network requests:

{{< figure src="/images/content/dc-request-second-site.jpg" class="left-align" title="Request to DoubleClick on the second site" >}}

It's another request to DoubleClick. This time the subdomain might be different, e.g. `https://98765432.fls.doubleclick.net/activityi...`, but since the cookie is written on the eTLD+1, you can see the result in the screenshot:

**The `DSID` value is exactly the same as on the other website.**

Thus, when you visit these two sites without restricting access to cookies in a third-party context, DoubleClick will know that your particular `DSID` is now associated with visits to these two websites.

This is how ad tech vendors leverage cookie access in a third-party context to profile internet users.
